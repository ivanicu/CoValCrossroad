# Retractions

Every claim this repository made and then killed, scoped or corrected — in the order
it happened, with what did the killing.

The rounds are numbered by when they ran, not by what survived. Read in that order
the repository looks like a sequence of findings. It is not. **Nine of these entries
are a later round destroying an earlier round's conclusion, and in seven of them
both rounds are mine.**

This file exists because the git log has all of it and nobody reads a git log.

| # | The claim | What killed or scoped it | What survived |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"Governance uncertainty exceeds sampling uncertainty at k=4"** (+0.028), inherited from the source package and reproduced bit-identically | Matched-pairing analysis. The two halves were different objects: a distance from a bootstrap to a **noise-free reference** versus a distance between **two objects both carrying noise**. Under either matched pairing the sign reverses: −0.032 draw-vs-draw, −0.003 reference-vs-reference | The k-curve shape. The zero crossing moves from between k=5 and k=6 to between k=1 and k=2 |
| 2 | **"2.96% of crowd-written criteria address anthropomorphism"** (r07, first lexicon) | Substring matching. `persona` was catching *personal*, *personality*, *personalities*; `friend` was catching *friendly*, *friendships*. 321 of 452 hits were false | Word-boundary regexes give **0.16%** — twelve times smaller. The finding got *stronger* via a bug |
| 3 | **Pre-registered gaming prediction**: a majority-generic target should show rising verbosity and criterion-keyword overlap under optimization (r09) | r09 itself. Every marker **fell**: words 125→116, overlap 0.307→0.284, bullets 1.62→1.34 | Nothing of the prediction. Reported as refuted rather than reframed |
| 4 | **"Optimizing the rubric improves held-out preference"** (+0.53 [0.06, 0.99], r09) | r11's independent-backbone control. The gold head shared Qwen3.5-2B with the judge. On an independent 0.8B backbone the change is **+0.05 [−0.44, +0.53]** — indistinguishable from zero | Only the bound: *no overoptimization detected at this pressure, and no improvement established either*. r09 had passed its own positive control and its own paired test |
| 5 | **Assurance claim C6 passed** while testing `positive_control_passed`, a field unrelated to its own statement about lexical overlap | Reading the claim next to its test. Rewritten to test what it asserts; it now **FAILS** at −0.0229 | The habit, generalised: every claim's test must be readable against its own sentence |
| 6 | **"The advantage is response-set-specific"** — criteria were written after their authors read the four candidates, so they encode facts about them (r12) | r13. Seed criteria, prepared alongside candidate generation and **never tailored to those responses**, carry *more* attribution (+0.039, CI excludes 0) than write-ins authored after reading them (+0.029, CI includes 0) | The datum: the advantage does not transfer, +0.102 → −0.042. Only the mechanism died, and what replaced it is stranger |
| 7 | **The whole assurance manifest**, after the repository was reorganised into `rounds/` | Running it. Every claim source had moved and all thirteen resolved to `UNSUPPORTED`, which reads as *not yet measured* rather than *this package can no longer find its own evidence* | A new status, `BROKEN_HARNESS`, that refuses to emit a manifest at all |
| 8 | **r17's first design** — route a rater on half a prompt's criteria, score them on the rest | The data. Every prompt shows the same six seed criteria: 731 prompts have exactly 6, none has 10, and a k=4 core consumes four. **No held-out design at the criterion level is possible on CoVal** | The constraint became a finding, and routing moved to cross-prompt history |
| 9 | **"Preserving disagreement harms the worst-off bloc"** (r16) | r17. With routing learned from a rater's *other* prompts, conditional directions help exactly the rules carrying contested items — conflict_aware +0.195, constituency +0.148 — while consensus-seeking rules move by less than 0.02 | The ranking. Conditional conflict_aware still reaches only 2.999 against un-conditioned utility at 3.609. The correct claim is narrower: preserving disagreement **with a single direction** harms the worst-off bloc |
| 10 | **My own suspicion** that r17's 84.6% routing accuracy was entirely free | r18. The inflation is real, +0.147 — but on contested items the router still reaches **0.666 [0.643, 0.688]**, nowhere near chance | Routing works, and works far less often than the headline implied. *The first time the data corrected a doubt of mine rather than a claim* |
| 11 | **"Less than half of a values evaluation measures values"** — reported as 43% | r19. The shuffled arm used a **random** donor, which retains 47–60% of the self signal because a random prompt sometimes shares topic. Against a nearest-topic floor the attribution is 0.047; against the farthest, 0.115. **Span 2.47×** | The bracket, 27%–67%, and the rule that any single figure must name its floor |
| 12 | **r19's own first bracket**, 29%–63% | r19's proper runner. The inline version averaged in a judge cell whose self accuracy was **0.5405** — barely above chance, therefore not decomposable. Excluding it *widened* the spread to 27%–67% | The direction is worth noting: the reported interval was too **narrow**, and it was narrow because noise had been averaged in as data |

## The adversary round — 2026-07-28

Entries 1–12 were found by me. Every one of them.

On 2026-07-28 three independent clean-context challengers were given a frozen clone
at `87ef2ab`, one lens each — statistics, construct validity, reproducibility — and
**no sight of [ADVERSARY_BRIEF.md](assurance/ADVERSARY_BRIEF.md)**, which had been
withheld precisely so that what they found could be scored against what I predicted
they would find. In roughly 45 minutes each they produced the following. Nine of the
twelve are theirs.

| # | The claim | What killed or scoped it | What survived |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | **r01's response-style control**, reported as one of three independent ways the persistence could have died (0.1479 → 0.1471) | My own gauge test, prompted by the reviews. **Pearson correlation is invariant to per-rater affine rescaling**, so z-scoring each rater within a prompt cannot move a Pearson-based agreement — ever. Measured: **131,771 of 131,771 dyads unchanged, median \|Δ\| = 5.55e-17**, machine epsilon | The persistence. But it was defended by **two** controls, not three; the third was algebra wearing the costume of evidence |
| 14 | **r01's ρ=0.147 as evidence for structured plurality (M2)**, the premise the whole r16/r17/r18 arm is built on | Statistics review, then [r23](rounds/r23_actor_vs_dyad). Agreement persists with **no blocs at all** if raters merely differ in reliability — a careful rater agrees with everyone. That is an additive **actor** effect, and r01's null (shuffling rater IDs) destroys actor and dyad identity together, so it had nowhere to land but "structure". Fitting `A_ij = μ + a_i + a_j` per prompt: the actor model takes **47.2%** of dyad variance and actor-only persistence is **0.254** — *higher than the headline itself* | Only the residual: pair-specific ρ=**0.034**, z=**+4.67** against a dyad-permutation null. Real, and **20–23% of what r01 reported**. The sharper test — an excess of pairs reliably negative in *both* halves, which reliability heterogeneity cannot produce because noise attenuates toward zero and never below it — **returns null at z=+1.40**. So the residual is equally consistent with unequal-size blocs and with a second axis of rater competence. **M2 is weakened, not rescued** |
| 15 | **r13's attribution, +0.039 seed vs +0.029 write-in** — the numbers that killed entry 6's mechanism | Statistics review; confirmed at the object. `run.py:164` computed `arr[:len(sa)].mean() - sa.mean()`: a **positional prefix** of an all-prompts array minus a differently-ordered subset, printed beside a `real` spanning all 968. The columns do not subtract to the published figure — **0.5835 − 0.5368 = 0.0468, but 0.0391 was reported**. A comment asserted pairing was unavailable; the pids were in hand and simply never recorded | Refit per prompt with a paired bootstrap: seed **+0.0457** [+0.0234,+0.0687] (n=300), write-in **+0.0262** [+0.0022,+0.0506] (n=293), gap **+0.0194**. The reviewer predicted the gap would collapse ~5× under a matched computation; **it roughly doubled** — their diagnosis of the bug was exact and their forecast of its direction was not, which is why a bug must be fixed and re-run rather than argued about. **But the write-in interval now excludes zero**, and *"write-ins carry no significant attribution"* was half of entry 6's argument. See the amendment below |
| 16 | **Assurance claim C1 HOLDS** | Reproducibility review. C1 asserts a **proportion** ("less than half of a rubric's ability") and tested `rubric_contribution` — a raw 0.0791 accuracy-point difference — against 0.5. Pairwise accuracy differences cannot reach 0.5, so **the test returns HOLDS at a true share of 90%** | The claim (42.5% < 50%), not the check. Rewired to test the share. **Second live instance of the exact class entry 5 claimed to have generalised away** |
| 17 | **That r13 is a CPU round that reproduces as documented** | Reproducibility review, by running it. Without `--with-shuffled` it wrote a 4-line JSON over the 20-line one, **silently deleting the attribution fields entry 6 stands on**, and exited 0 | A guard that refuses to overwrite a richer result, writes the partial elsewhere, and names the missing flag. Attacked before being believed |
| 18 | **Three README numbers** | Reproducibility review. Span **2.2×** where three other places in the repo say 2.47×; most-dissimilar-donor **0.102**, which is r12's in-distribution figure transplanted (r19 says 0.115); "the official core scores 0.660, **level with** the best simple rule" | The 0.660 is real — but it is r04-core, released rubric, 968 prompts, against r06's k=4 compression of `coval_full` on 945. **Nothing ever measured them against each other.** Two of the three are entry 12 not propagated to the prose |
| 19 | **"step R²=0.964 vs trend 0.448"** | Both reviews independently: **no script in the repository computed it.** `git log --all -S"0.964"` finds it only in prose. Worse, a free-breakpoint step charges nothing for choosing its breakpoint, so beating a straight line is close to automatic | [r24](rounds/r24_regime_receipt) supplies the receipt and the control it never had: breakpoint found by **search** (independently at position 6), against a null that **re-searches the breakpoint on every shuffle**. Null best-step R² = 0.172; observed 0.964, z=+7.09, **p=0.0001**. Within-segment slopes +6.84 and +1.04. The claim survives, stronger than when it was asserted |
| 20 | **r07's Tier-1 anthropomorphism rate, 0.16%** | Construct review, by reading all 24 hits. 7–8 of the 9 `personal opinion` matches **instruct the model to avoid** opinions; one `as an ai` hit is literally an anti-anthropomorphism disclosure rule; 4 `persona` hits are content roleplay on request. At most 11/24 are on-construct — true rate **~0.05–0.09%** | The direction, more extremely. **The same lexicon that produced entry 2 failed a second time**, in the same way, after being "fixed" |
| 21 | **That r16's blocs are a constituency** | Construct review, substituting demographic strata the release actually ships. Gender split regret **1.145**, country split **1.198** — both below r16's **own** 1.15×-random bar of 1.267 | The regret arithmetic and r18's contested-item router (0.6656, reproduced exactly). Not the word "minority", which no test in this repository supports |
| 22 | **ASSURANCE's population boundary, "1,012 annotators"** | Reproducibility review's from-scratch recount, reproduced independently here. The release has **two** populations, not one. Comparison rankings: 1,012, every one of whom also scored criteria. Criterion scoring: **1,160** distinct raters, of whom **148 (12.8%) appear in no annotator record** and therefore carry **no demographic, country or consent metadata at all** | The comparison rounds. Not the scope sentence — and this is load-bearing for entry 21: the demographic substitution that showed r16's blocs are not a gender or country constituency **could only be computed on the 87.2% who have demographics.** A bloc analysis cannot be checked against strata for raters who have none. Both the original bloc claim and its refutation are scoped to that subset |
| 23 | **That this file is complete** — "Every claim this repository made and then killed" | Reproducibility review. `r15`'s stored result carries both `conclusion` and `conclusion_original`, the latter headed **SCOPE CORRECTION**, and the commit message names it. `grep -in "r15" RETRACTIONS.md` → **zero hits** | Nothing. A ledger of retractions that omits a retraction is the failure it exists to catch |
| 24 | **r05's stated justification for using two instruments** — "embedding similarity 0.736 vs 0.520" | Construct review, confirmed by grep and `git log --all -S`. The number appears in **one docstring**, entered in the commit that created the file, and is computed **nowhere** | **UNVERIFIED**, which is not an acquittal. Separately: r05's actual headline *survived* a genuinely different instrument (TF-IDF cosine, family ranking ρ=0.93) — the round I most expected to fall |
| 25 | **Entry 6's entire argument** — "seed criteria carry attribution (CI excludes 0) and write-ins do not (CI includes 0), therefore seeds carry *more*", the asymmetry that made the response-set mechanism look dead | Entry 15's repair, then the interval I had never computed. **Both halves fail.** Write-ins clear zero after all (**+0.0262 [+0.0022, +0.0506]**). And the difference, bootstrapped paired on the 293 prompts carrying both arms, is **+0.0231 [−0.0079, +0.0541] — it includes zero.** The ordering is not established | Not the comparison. What survives is a **one-arm** argument, which is different and narrower: seed criteria — prepared alongside candidate generation and never tailored to those responses — carry **+0.0457 [+0.0234, +0.0687]** on their own. If the advantage were knowledge of the response set, response-blind criteria should carry ~none, and they carry as much as write-ins do. That still refuses the response-set mechanism; it no longer ranks the two. **And even that rests on a proxy**: "seed" is inferred from rating count, not read from a release field (below) |
| 26 | **The direction of the correction itself** — that fixing a broken estimator makes a finding firmer | The same run. The point estimate rose at every repair — **+0.0102** broken, **+0.0194** unpaired means, **+0.0231** properly paired — while the claim got *weaker at every step*, because the uncertainty was never computed until last. A bigger number and a dead claim, from one bootstrap | The rule, in its sharpest form yet: **the size of an effect and the strength of a claim are independent quantities, and this repository spent twenty rounds reporting the first as though it were the second** |

### Scoring the pre-registration

The brief bet on which claims would fall. Its own stated purpose: *"if a challenger
overturns something from the safe column, my sense of my own work is worse calibrated
than I think — and that is the more useful result."*

| | Predicted | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** blocs | falls | **fell**, by the exact attack named (demographic strata) |
| **A2** r05 compression | falls | **held** under a different lexical instrument |
| **A3** r07 lexicon | falls | **fell**, harder — hits are not merely noisy, several are *reversed* |
| **A4/A5** judge, gold model | falls | untested — GPU was withheld from the challengers |
| **B1** r01 persistence | safest | **hit twice**: interpretation overturned, and one of its three controls was algebra |
| **B2** singleton arithmetic | safe | **exact**, on an independent from-scratch recount |
| **B3** two-regime step | safe | **UNVERIFIED** — no code existed — then confirmed by r24 |
| **B4** r19 span 2.47× | safe | **exact**, twice — while the README quoted 2.2× |

**Two of four "safest" claims went down; two of three testable "likely to fall" fell.**
Calibration on the risky column was good and on the safe column was bad, which is the
worse of the two ways to be wrong: the claims I defended hardest were the ones I had
stopped attacking.

## The pattern

Entries 1–12 were one failure. Entries 13–24 are **two**, and the second is new.

### First: a number reported without the scope over which it holds

Eleven of the first twelve, and 14 · 18 · 19 · 20 · 21 · 22 of the second batch. It is
the failure this repository's North Star names:

> **a number was reported without the scope over which it holds.**

- an uncertainty compared against a differently-paired uncertainty (1)
- a lexicon whose match rule was not the concept (2)
- a gold model whose backbone was shared with the thing it judged (4)
- a claim whose test was not its statement (5)
- a mechanism attributed to a datum that did not require it (6)
- a manifest that could not tell *unmeasured* from *unfindable* (7)
- a metric that assumed an output format the claim did not (9)
- an accuracy averaged over cases where nothing had to be decided (10)
- a floor treated as measured when it was chosen (11, 12)

The exception is 3 — a prediction that was simply wrong.

### Second: an instrument that could not have returned the other answer

This class does not appear once in entries 1–12. It appears **four times** in 13–24,
and it is worse, because a claim with a missing scope is at least *measuring* something:

- **a control invariant by construction** (13) — Pearson cannot see a per-rater
  rescaling, so the control could only ever return "survived"
- **a check whose threshold is unreachable** (16) — a proportion claim tested as a raw
  difference against 0.5, on a quantity bounded far below it
- **a null that shares the observed statistic's selection advantage** (19) — a
  free-breakpoint step compared against a fixed-form line
- **a permutation null that destroys two things at once** (14) — r01 shuffled rater
  IDs, killing actor identity and dyad identity together, so an actor effect had
  nowhere to land except the "structure" column

The diagnostic is one question, and it costs nothing: **name the world in which this
check returns the other answer.** If you cannot, you have not built a check. Three of
these four were invisible to twenty rounds of my own review and took an outsider, or a
three-line piece of algebra, to see.

## What this costs and what it buys

Of the first twelve, **seven were caught by a later round of my own**. Of the next
twelve, **nine were caught by outsiders in about forty-five minutes each** — against
roughly twenty rounds of self-review that had already passed over every one of them.

That ratio is the finding. Not because the challengers were better, but because they
were **elsewhere**: a reviewer sampled from the process that produced the material can
only attack what that process already anticipated, which is exactly why those parts
read as fluent. The three defects I found myself in this round (13, and the design
weaknesses repaired in r23 and r24) all came *after* reading someone else's attack —
the outsider did not have to name them, only to point near them.

**The expensive part of this project was never any experiment. It was noticing which
number had not been asked where it stops being true — and that turned out to be a
thing I cannot reliably do to my own work.**
