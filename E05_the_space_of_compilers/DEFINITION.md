# The definition, stated once

`FORMULATION.md` is 2,000+ lines and is the **evidence record** — every clause that was written,
attacked and corrected, in the order it happened. It is titled *"stated once"* and it opens with a
correction, because the statement itself was never separated from its history.

**This file is the statement.** Every number in it is checked against a committed artifact on every
run by [`assurance/definition_matches_the_record.py`](../assurance/definition_matches_the_record.py),
so it cannot drift from the evidence without the suite failing.

## The definition

> A **core** for a conversation is a small set of evaluation criteria, **producible from the
> conversation alone**, that
>
> **③** uses **no information from that prompt's own human labels** — not from the construction, not
> from any half of them, **and not by way of a rubric those same annotators wrote**; **and**
>
> **②** scores better, **under a named judge J**, than a size-matched criterion set that never read
> the conversation.
>
> Its size, **under that same judge J**, is **greater than one**; sizes **3 to 8 are not
> distinguishable** by this release.

**Clause ① is not a clause.** It is a consequence — see below.

---

## What each clause is measured to do

| clause | excludes | status | scope |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **①** better than a random draw of the prompt's own rubric | **0 of 41** | **DERIVED** — the region where ① could bind is empty by arithmetic (`GAP ≥ SLACK` on every arm) | R347 |
| **②** better than a prompt-blind set | **33 of 42** | **MEASURED** — carries the whole boundary among label-free arms | R360 |
| **③** no prompt labels | **4 of 42** | **DERIVED** that it excludes the label-users; **MEASURED** that nothing else can | R360 |

### ① — a consequence, not a test

On this arm space clause ② **implies** clause ①. The cell *(① fails, ② passes)* is **empty**, and
empty **by derivation**: a counterexample needs `GAP < SLACK`, and the measured minimum GAP exceeds
the maximum SLACK on all 41 arms. It could not have come out otherwise.

**Do not delete it** — the implication rests on a *measured* reference gap, not on the definition's
own logic, so a release with a weaker blind reference restores its bite. **State it as a consequence
and stop presenting it as independent evidence.**

### ② — real, and it must carry a judge index

It excludes the most, and every one of the following is measured:

- It tests a **curated instrument, not blindness.** Crowd-written sets that never read the
  conversation do *no better* than clause ①'s own reference, and 2 of 5 are resolvably worse. *(R348)*
- The reference is `POOL[0:k]` — chosen by **file order** — sitting at the **93.7th percentile** of
  all 1,820 size-4 subsets, where it admits **3 members of the class the clause defines itself
  against**. *(R331)*
- The admitted set is **not stable**: two distinct sets inside **0.25 of one MDE**. *(R332)*
- The "closure level" is the **first** closed reference, not the lowest safe one — at 6 of 9 k,
  **stronger** references admit blind sets again. This replicates at a second judge, so it is a
  property of the **estimator**, not of one model. *(R355, R358)*
- **It is emptied by a change of judge**: **5** arms admitted at Qwen3.5-2B-Base, **0** at
  Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base, on all 41 arms. *(R301)*
- **Self-normalising does not repair that.** At matched strictness the relative and absolute forms
  are indistinguishable — 9 vs 9 at 2B, 0 vs 0 at 0.8B. The judge-dependence is in the **arms'
  ordering**, which no reference can reorder. *(R359, R356, R357)*

**Therefore clause ② is stated with a judge index and the claim it licenses is *"a core under J"*,
never *"a core"*.**

⭐ **AND J CAN NOW BE NAMED (R367).** The rule: **name the judge that best tracks the human.** On the
full rubric — a fixed criterion set that is neither an admitted arm nor the clause-② reference — A2
is **0.5087 at 2B against 0.4120 at 0.8B**, paired **+0.0967 vs MDE 0.0160**.

⛔ **And that rule names the judge under which the definition is non-empty, which is the answer
already published — so it was checked against a DEFINITION-EXTERNAL channel.** On the release's
`unacceptable` ratings, which no clause of the definition reads, 2B ranks the unacceptable response
last **0.7019** of the time against 0.8B's **0.5839** (paired +0.1180 vs MDE 0.0638, on the **161**
prompts carrying such a rating). **Same judge named.** A synthetic judge built to rank it last scores
1.0000, so the channel can separate; shuffled labels score 0.59–0.63, which is where **0.8B nearly
sits**.

⚠ The external rule resolves at **1.85×** its MDE against the adjacent rule's 6×, and **two judges can
refute a rule and never establish one.** What is earned is *"not refuted, and not circular on the one
external channel available"*.

### ③ — the one unsubstitutable clause

That clause ③ excludes the four label-using arms is **forced** — it *is* "no prompt labels". The
measured part is that **nothing else can do its job**:

> Across all **45** reference levels the label-user count **never falls below 4**, while the
> published five fall to **0** at the strongest reference. At p=100 the only arms still admitted are
> the four that read the prompt's labels. *(R360)*

**Strengthening clause ② removes the arms the definition exists to admit and leaves exactly the arms
it exists to exclude.**

⛔ **AND THAT IS 2B-SPECIFIC (R361).** At Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base the label-user count over the same sweep
falls to **0** — references *do* purge them there. The rank dominance is **resolved at 2B**
(gap −4.50, exact two-sided p = **0.0159** over all C(9,4)=126 assignments) and **not resolved at
0.8B** (+2.25, p = 0.2857), so the inversion is a direction rather than a finding.

**Corrected: clause ③ is unsubstitutable at 2B; at 0.8B a strong enough reference substitutes for
it.** The *rule* still stands — it is a **provenance** requirement that applies by inspection and
needs no judge at all. That is a weaker and different argument than irreplaceability.

And its wording is load-bearing: it must say **held out from the PROMPT**, not "from the
construction". Three fitted arms pass the weaker reading, and in the quintile where two annotator
halves disagree **their entire advantage is gone**. *(R295)*

⛔ **AND AS IMPLEMENTED IT CLOSES ONLY THE RANKING CHANNEL (R363).** Clause ③ is applied everywhere
by one hand-written set — `{oracle_k4, oracle_k4_fit1, greedy_k4_fit1, indep_k4_fit1}` — duplicated
across four rounds. Audited against `corebench/select_core.py`, that set is **correct about the
rankings**: `comparisons.jsonl` is opened only for `oracle_k / indep_k / greedy_k`.

But `topw_k` — **four of the published five** — selects on `w = mean importance score` from
`conversation_rubrics.jsonl`, and the annotators who wrote those scores are, at **95.3%**, the same
people whose rankings define that prompt's target (cross-prompt sham **0.016**, ratio **58×**, over
**1,160** distinct annotators against a median panel of 16; **473 of 968** prompts have complete
overlap and **none** has zero).

⚠ **MEASURED** is the overlap — a census, with no judge anywhere in it. **DERIVED**, from that plus
this release's own finding that rubrics are authored *after* ranking, is that `topw_k` is **not
producible from the conversation alone**.

✅ **AND THE CHANNEL CARRIES NOTHING MEASURABLE (R364).** Rebuilding `topw_k4`'s weights from
annotators overlapping the evaluators in a swept fraction, the margin is **flat**: paired
`margin(d=1) − margin(d=0)` is **−0.0000 against its own MDE of 0.0096**, with three seeds
straddling zero. A **planted** person-specific channel is detected from **+0.0297** upward and not
at g=0, so the null has demonstrated power; the sham that permutes *which annotator's scores carry
which id* lands inside the MDE, so the dose was measuring identity.

⚠ **A bound, not a zero:** `topw_k4`'s margin is +0.0139, so this rules out a channel larger than
~69% of it and says nothing about a smaller one. **So clause ③'s wording was wrong and stays
corrected; the published five are not compromised at this resolution.**

⭐ **AND IT IS NOT A 2B STATEMENT (R365).** The dose is flat at **both** judges — −0.0000 vs MDE
0.0096 at 2B, **+0.0000 vs MDE 0.0107 at 0.8B** — and 0.8B's MDE is only **1.11×** 2B's, so that
design could have excluded what 2B excluded. The planted channel is detected at **both** judges and
undetected at g=0 at both, so neither null is silence. **After a change of judge emptied clause ②,
inverted an arm family's ordering, destroyed the size band's premise and cost clause ③ its
irreplaceability, this is the first claim here to come through unchanged.**

⚠ Two judges can **refute** instrument-independence and never establish it, so what is earned is
**"not refuted at a second judge"** — and at 0.8B the level itself is unresolved (−0.0126 vs 0.0145),
so it is a flat dose on a null level.

⛔ **AND THAT SURVIVAL IS CHEAPER THAN IT SOUNDS (R366).** Under **any** scaling `x → βx` a true
**zero maps to zero exactly**, while a true nonzero maps to `β·nonzero` and may fall below its MDE —
so **a null surviving a shrink is the cheapest possible survival**, and this claim is a null. My own
explanation for it — *"it is a difference, and differences are what shrink transformations
preserve"* — is **refuted**: R362's size-band steps are differences of differences too, and **1 of 3**
survive. Over the whole population of **7** claims run at both judges, neither `difference` (Fisher
**p = 1.0000**) nor `null` (**p = 0.4286**) sorts survival, on a test where a perfect split **would**
have reached **p = 0.0286**. **So nothing in this record predicts which claims survive the judge, and
the proposal to restate the definition in differences is withdrawn.**

---

## The size

**Not four.** The release ships exactly one core, of size four, and "four criteria" was a
description of that instance rather than a property of the category — the k-sweep cannot separate 3
from 8. The largest identifiable *member* core is **k ≤ 2**; the class is identifiable where the
member is not. *(R224, R228, R230)*

**State the bound the design supports: more than one, and 3–8 indistinguishable.**

⛔ **AND THAT BAND IS ALSO JUDGE-INDEXED (R362).** At 0.8B there is no band to bound: the rubric's
top-k margin against a size-matched blind reference is **negative at 6 of 7 sizes** and resolvably so
at k=12. Only the band's **exit** (8→12) resolves at both judges; both entry steps (1→2, 2→3) resolve
at 2B and not at 0.8B, and 0.8B resolves an interior step (3→4) that 2B does not.

⚠ The median margin ratio is **−0.343** against R301's fitted shrink **β = +0.401** — a *sign
inversion* at **4 of 7 sizes**, not attenuation. Two parts of the size question were **not** re-run
because they are settled: the upper bound `k_max = max{k : C(n,k) ≤ a(m)}` is **combinatorial with no
judge in it** (R224/R228), and the k-curve's *shape* across judges was already measured by R356
(ρ = +0.667, inside its forced band).

## What this definition cannot claim

| | |
|---|---|
| **"a core", unindexed** | the admitted set is **empty at the second judge**; only *"a core under J"* is licensed — and J is named by R367's rule, not chosen |
| **a count of admitted arms** | the set moves within **0.25 MDE** (R332) and with the reference's percentile (R354) |
| **that its three clauses each test something** | one excludes nothing, one is judge-emptied, one is irreplaceable |
| **an unindexed size** | at 0.8B top-k loses to a size-matched blind set at **6 of 7** sizes (R362) |
| **that it works on responses it was NOT scored against** | **unresolved against a fair floor** — see the transport note below (R368, R370) |
| **transfer to another criterion pool** | every level here is a fact about **this 16-criterion pool** (R331) |
| **transfer to another release** | ~~one release~~ — ⛔ **RETRACTED 2026-08-04 (R398). This line was never a wall; it was a query nobody ran.** `data/utterances.jsonl` — **68 MB, fetched 2026-07-29** and referenced by 0 files in this repository — holds **68,371 rows over 8,011 conversations, 100% carrying a human `score`, with 26,285 prompts having ≥2 distinct model responses across 21 models.** A second corpus has been on disk the whole time. ⚠ It has **no rubric**, so clauses defined against `full` still cannot transport; **clause ② and the human-agreement target can.** |

---

## ⛔ CORRECTION 2026-08-04 — the limit below is not structural, it is untested

The transport section closes on R233's limit, stated in the definition's strongest terms: the fresh
responses carry **no human rankings**, so transport is of the **compilation** and *"never agreement
with people"*. **That sentence describes this release, and was silently read as describing the
world.**

[`R398`](A24_what_the_definition_costs/R398_is_there_a_second_object_on_disk) asked the cheapest
question left and it had never been asked: **a second corpus with 68,371 human-scored responses has
been sitting in `data/` since 2026-07-29, referenced by no round and named in no document.**

**What changes:** *"agreement with people on responses the core was not built for"* moves from
**impossible** to **untested**. **What does not:** every number below still stands as measured — R398
ran no transport test, computed no core, and reports no effect. It established that the object exists
and nothing more.

## Transport — the clause this definition does not have

Every clause above certifies a core against **the four responses it was scored on**. Nothing says it
works on new ones, and until R368 nothing had measured it: `transport` appeared here **zero** times.

Matched on per-prompt difficulty — the confound R233 named when it declined its own verdict — the
core reproduces the full rubric's ordering on **unseen** responses better than a size-matched random
draw, by **+0.0992 against an MDE of 0.0654** on R233's own exact-class metric, and **+0.0612 vs
0.0535** on a finer pair metric. Same sign, both resolved.

⚠ **Marginal, and stated as such**: 1.52× and 1.14× of their own MDEs, where the MDE is computed over
**4 strata** — the effective n is the strata, not the 250 prompts.

⚠ **And the shape underneath is unexplained.** The core is **at or below random on the responses it
was built for** and above random on responses it was not. **[UNTESTED]** nothing here explains that,
and it is recorded as the residual.

⚠ **R233's limit does not move:** the fresh responses carry **no human rankings**, so this is
transport of the **compilation** — agreement with the full rubric — and never agreement with people.

⛔ **AND THE CONTRAST DECOMPOSES THE OPPOSITE WAY UNDER THE TWO METRICS (R369).** R368 computed the
floors per stratum per arm and never printed them: `Δfloor` is **+0.0308** on exact and **−0.0187** on
pair — under one metric the random baseline **rises** on the fresh arm, under the other it **falls**.
The instability is **bounded**: `Δcore` is positive under both (**+0.1300**, +0.0425) and larger in
magnitude than `Δfloor` in both, so the core term dominates either way. What is metric-dependent is
the **attribution of magnitude**, not the direction.

⚠ And a structural asymmetry remains unseparated: the floor is drawn from **`full`'s own criteria** —
among the items summed to make the target — while the core is a rewrite. A difference-in-differences
cancels that only if it is additive across arms, which the flipping `Δfloor` puts in doubt.
Separating it needs a floor drawn from criteria **outside `full`**.

⛔ **AND AGAINST A FLOOR THAT IS NOT A SUBSET OF ITS OWN TARGET, IT DOES NOT RESOLVE (R370).** The
suspicion was testable and the test needed new labels: the generic 16-criterion pool, identical
across prompts and therefore outside any prompt's `full` rubric by construction, judged against the
fresh responses (16,000 labels). With that floor the contrast is **+0.0810 vs MDE 0.0920** (exact)
and **+0.0161 vs 0.0251** (pair) — **inside the MDE on both**.

**The subset advantage is now a number**: on the original arm the subset floor sits **+0.1413** above
the non-subset floor (exact; +0.0662 on pair). A random draw from `full`'s own criteria reproduces
`full` far better than an external pool does.

⚠ **Not refuted — not resolved.** Both point estimates stay positive; with a fair floor this design
**cannot resolve** transport. And the collapse arrives two ways: on `pair` the contrast falls **74%**
while the MDE shrinks, on `exact` the contrast barely moves and the **MDE grows 41%**.

⛔ **AND THAT VERDICT IS ITSELF A SPECIFICATION CHOICE (R371).** R370 fixed the stratification at
**S = 4** and never swept it. Sweeping S on the same data, the `exact` contrast **resolves at S = 2
and S = 5** and does not at S = 3, 4, 6, 8. On `pair` it is inside the MDE at every S. So
*"transport collapses"* is what S=4 says, not what the data says.

⚠ The between-stratum spread is **sampling noise, not structure**: against a *no-heterogeneity* null
the median ratio is **0.98**. And the MDE **rises** with S, because smaller strata get noisier faster
than √S recovers — so more prompts would help only **at fixed S**, never by adding strata.

⛔⛔ **AND R371'S OWN READING DIED THE SAME WAY (R372) — the curve is no more reportable than the
cell was.** R371 closed by saying *"the honest statement is the curve, not the cell."* Re-run on
**480 random halves** of the same 250 prompts:

| | |
|---|---:|
| R371's set `{2, 5}` recurs | **2.9%** of halves |
| modal outcome | **∅**, at **41.5%** — with **38** distinct sets |
| two halves of one split agree on the set | **4.4%** *(both-empty agreements removed)* |
| `exact` set at full n under an order-independent floor | **{2, 3, 5}**, not `{2, 5}` |

**And the curve's shape is a derivation, not a measurement:** R371 itself measured that the MDE rises
with S while the contrast does not, which makes the resolution rate fall with S **by algebra**.
**S = 2 tops every ranking because its between-stratum sd has ONE degree of freedom and collapses**
— below half the typical contrast in **28.3%** of halves against at most **7.3%** anywhere else
(3.9×). The tell was a full-sample `pair|2` cell returning **MDE = 0.0007**.

⚠ R371's floor was also **order-dependent** — one rng shared across a call, so a prompt's floor
depended on its company. 12 permutations move the `exact|S=4` contrast across **+0.0540 … +0.1185**.

⛔ **AND R368'S OWN MDE IS UNDER-PRICED, WHICH THE CAMPAIGN HAD NO RECORD TO NOTICE (R373).** The
transport MDE above divides by the square root of a count of **strata**, and that count is **4**. A
4-unit sd estimate lands **below half its true value 13.9%** of the time and below three quarters
**36.0%** of the time — so `+0.0992 vs 0.0654` is a comparison against a threshold that is itself a
4-point estimate. **Not refuted; under-priced** — and the distinction matters because nobody
re-examines a cell that reported RESOLVED.

⚠ Of **55** MDE call sites across **38** rounds, **5** divide by a count of aggregated units rather
than the sample, and after resolving each k, **R368 is the only one outside R370–R372 with k < 10**
(R355 is flagged and its k is **25**, which is fine). *The flag is not the severity; only k is.*

> **`The resolving set` is not a well-defined object of this design.** R371 was right that R370's
> S = 4 was a specification choice, and then read a SET off the same single draw — **the error it
> convicted R370 of, one level up.**

**So transport is a stated LIMIT, not a candidate clause** — and the limit is now stronger and
simpler than R370's or R371's version: **the transport contrast is not resolvable by this design at
any stratification, and no stratum count is preferable to another on this data.** R368's number
stands as a number; what it measured was the floor.

## The one sentence

> **What survives every attack in this campaign is clause ③'s RULE — but stated more strictly than
> the campaign has ever implemented it, and on provenance rather than irreplaceability.** Clause ① is a consequence, clause ② holds only under a named judge, the size is
> a bound rather than a number, and *"nothing else can do clause ③'s job"* is **2B-specific**
> (R361). What is left is the rule itself: **a core may not be built from the labels of the prompt
> it is for** — which is checkable by inspection, needs no judge, and is the one claim here that no
> instrument can empty.

⚠ *That closing sentence was published unconditionally one round earlier and was corrected by
attacking it rather than by building on it. It had survived exactly one round.*
